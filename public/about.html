    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My name is Querley Junio, I'm from Brazil, I'm 22 years old and am
      currently studying very hard to become a professional developer! I'm
      really interested in web development, especially javascript with react.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the backend of things, I've spent a lot of time studying Java, with the
      Spring Framework. On the near future, I hope to land a job that will allow
      me gain real world experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love working with people, in the past I've taught english
      professionally, in private classes and schools, but after 4 years doing
      so, I felt it was past time to go after my dreams and pursue a career that
      would fulfill my creative aspirations.
